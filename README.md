ABSTRACT
---------------
This report outlines the development of a wall-climbing robot designed primarily for cleaning tasks, emphasizing its broader application in enhancing human safety within hazardous environments. The robot relies on a 30-amp SMPS supply, demonstrating not only efficient cleaning capabilities but also adaptability for various hazardous tasks. Its adhesion mechanism utilizes negative pressure, enabling secure attachment to vertical surfaces. Propulsion is facilitated by a 1400kv brushless DC motor, with four rubber wheels, driven by gear motors, providing omnidirectional movement on vertical surfaces. Precise control is achieved through meticulous coding executed by an Arduino Nano (ATmega328 microcontroller), ensuring safe and efficient operation. Constructed from lightweight Aluminum Composite Panels (ACP), the chassis maintains structural integrity while minimizing interference with the adhesion mechanism. A custom cleaning mechanism, actuated by a servo motor, seamlessly integrates with the robot's ability to cling to surfaces, offering a comprehensive cleaning solution without compromising adhesion. This robot can be utilized for a variety of hazardous tasks, providing a safety-focused solution that safeguards lives in perilous environments, marking a significant advancement in the field of robotics.â€ƒ
